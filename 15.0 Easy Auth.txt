## Easy Auth ##

In your routes you can put 
```
Route::controllers([
	'auth' => 'Auth\AuthController',
	'password' => 'Auth\PasswordController',
]);
```
and the do `getFoo` or orwhatever
but this is not reccomended

In `ArticlesController`, if we type
```
public function index()
{
	return \Auth::user()->name
}
```
then if you're logged in, it'll print your name
