## Named Routes ##
> this is from http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/routing#named-routes

Named routes allow you to conveniently generate URLs or redirects for a specific route. You may specify a name for a route with the as array key:
```
Route::get('user/profile', ['as' => 'profile', function()
{
    //
}]);
```
You may also specify route names for controller actions:
```
Route::get('user/profile', [
    'as' => 'profile', 'uses' => 'UserController@showProfile'
]);
```
Now, you may use the route's name when generating URLs or redirects:
```
$url = route('profile');

$redirect = redirect()->route('profile');
```
