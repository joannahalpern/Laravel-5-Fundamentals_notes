## Middleware are like Ogres ##

- Middleware makes it easy to redirect users who are not logged in to the login page

- It is found in `app\Http\Middleware`
- Authenticate - used to redirect ppl not logged in
- RedirectIfAuthenticated - use to redirect user who are logged in

- Register your middleware in `app\Http\kernel`
	- Everything in the funtion `$middleware` will be done at every single request
	- `$routeMiddleware` - attaching middleware only to specific routes

So in`app\Http\kernel` we have:
```
	protected $routeMiddleware = [
		'auth' => 'App\Http\Middleware\Authenticate',
		'auth.basic' => 'Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\AuthenticateWithBasicAuth',
		'guest' => 'App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfAuthenticated',
	];
```
And we will now put in `ArticlesController`:
```
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth');
    }
```
This means that for the entire ArticlesController, it will use the middleware 'auth' to authenicate the user.
Now if you are not logged in, any page from the ArcticlesController will redirect you to the login page. 

To apply this not to all of the ArticlesController but only to specific methods we do:
```
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth', ['only' => 'create']);
//or
        $this->middleware('auth', ['except' => 'index']);
    }
```

You can also add the middleware individually to your routes. 
Eg. In `routes`:
```
Route::get('about', ['middleware' => 'auth', 'uses' => 'PagesController@about']);

//or 

Route::get('about', ['middleware' => 'auth', function()
{
    return 'this page will only show if the user is signed in';
}
]);
```

- php artisan down - puts application in maintenance mode

**Create our own middleware**
1. `php artisan make:middleware RedirectIfNotAdmin`
2. put in RedirectIfNotAdmin:
```
	public function handle($request, Closure $next)
	{
        if ( ! $request->user()->isAdmin())
        {
            return redirect('articles');
        };
		return $next($request);
	}
```
3.Add `isAdmin()` function in User model.
4.Put it in `app\Http\Kernel`
```
	protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'admin' => 'App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfNotAdmin',
	];
```
5.Now you can add `'middleware' => 'auth'` to routes or controllers as shown above
