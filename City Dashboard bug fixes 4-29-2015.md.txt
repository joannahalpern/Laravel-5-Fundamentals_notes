## City Dashboard bug fixes 4/29/2015 ##

*Client*

* searching tag code of 0
* maybe add column in client for date account created
* *User Profile*
* Name should not contain . or any other symbols which are not allowed in an email (like consecutive .)
* *Pets and Payment*
* should say how much user owes (just like it shows how much administration owes)
* Refund and donate don't work
* *Add Pet*
* It doesn't work when age is 0, 0
* Update pet name works but gives an error message that it doesn't work


*Create User*

* the email sent to new account to create a password sends to the new home page instead of the create password page
* -if user already exists, then error message should say that-
* Limit how long the name can be

Little things

* should allow letters for apt No.
* -waiting signal for creating account- -it works on emili.net

*Update User*

* when you change email to existing email, it changes that users info to the new user
* Changing second half of email causes problems

*Commandes (Orders)*

* Bill button doesn't work
* problem changing collar number - it only works the second time you do it
* What's Type de facture (invoice type). Even when I made the payment Gratuit (complimentary) it still showed up as Achat



*Rapports*

* all reports are appearing 3 times

*Login* - no messages for wrong password or username

*Account - Manage Admins*

* modifying admin's email and name doesn't work (but changing permission level does work)

*Random* - can we delete CityHallRegister.php.orig
